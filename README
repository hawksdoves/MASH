Inspired by the children’s game, MASH.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASH_(game)

For this first draft, without a user interface, I have generated a random number to determine which “item” to cross off. After an item is crossed off, a new random number is generated and again the corresponding item is crossed off. This continues until there is only 1 item left in each of the categories.

The four categories are:
Where you will live (This is pre-determined: Mansion, Alley Way, Shed, House (MASH))
What car you will drive
Number of children you will have
Who you will marry
